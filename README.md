# Kiwi.com Modern JS weekend â€“ entry task
TLDR here is the link: [http://quick-flight-search.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ (http://quick-flight-search.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/)

This repository is used for entry task for Modern JS weekend. There is a simple use case.

- As a casual user I want to search available flight by cities and date.

## What I (not) used?
I did not focus too much on styling UI component (it was said in email with entry task). I did not spend so much time to show a lot of hot tenchnologies like a redux, because I want to go ahead forward to finish the task and It was not necessary to use them in this simple task.

It is based on create-react-app and for http requests handling and some state stuffs I use rxjs (because i like it). UI components came from ant design library. There are some tests but mainly focused for developing simple api client.

### Instalation
